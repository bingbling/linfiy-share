# Array

[Other Versions]()


## Description

Array allow you to store mutiple objects in single variable.

The Array class is only available in Javascript.

Here is basic example of what you can do with an array class:

> The [Array]() class is only available in JavaScript.

There are two types of arrays in Unity, Builtin arrays and normal JavaScript Arrays, Builin arrays(native .NET arrays), are extremely fast and efficient but they can not be resized.

They are statically typed which allows them to be edited in the inspector. Here is a basic example of how you can use builin arrays:

``` csharp
// example c# script showing how
// an array can be implemented.

using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class ExampleClass: MonoBehaviour {
  // Exposes an float array in the inspector, which you can edit there.
  public float[] values;

  void Start () {
    foreach (float value in values) {
      print(value);
    }

    // Since we can't resize builtin arrays 
    // we have to recreate the array to resize it
    values = new float[10];

    // assign the second element 
    value[1] = 5.0F;
  }
}
```

Builtin arrays are useful in performance critical code(WITH Unity's javascript and builtin arrays you could easily process 2 million vertices using the [mesh interface]() in one second.)

Normal Javascript Arrays on the other hand can be resizied, sorted and can do all other operations you  would expect from an array class. Javascript Arrays do not show up in the inspector. Note: You can easily convert between Javascript Arrays and builtin arrays.

> The [Array]() class is only available in JavaScript.

Note that Array functions are upper case following Unity's naming convention. As a convenience for javascript users, Unity also accepts lower case functions for the array class.

**Note:** Unity doesn't support serialization of a List of Lists, nor an Array of Arrays.
